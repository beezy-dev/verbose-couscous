### Kubernetes Security
Kubernetes is all about providing a high level of abstraction to reduce the application lifecycle dependency on the "from what the entire infrastructure stack is composed of, how it is configured and maintained". Interesting enough, the DevOps movement tries to build bridges to ease the collaboration between the Dev and Ops teams while Kubernetes provides an easy path to a self-service experience for Application teams with a fully decorrelation with the underlying platform.

The absraction does not reduce the importance of architecturing, building and maintaining a
platform within the industry and policy required practices to improve reslience and decrease the risks of cybersecurity breach. Considering the latter, the journey to secure an container platform is overwheelming. The below mindmap helps to define at a high level the different components requiring attention. Here is an example of such mindmap, work in progress and not a definite/static diagram:

This document is focusing on the ```Secrets``` component listed within the above diagram. 

### Kubernetes Secret Object

From an architecture standpoint, Kubernetes has a critical dependency on *etcd*, a key value store, acting as a distributed CMDB tracking the states of every components (from nodes, to config map, to services, ...).    
If *etcd* fails, the entire cluster will collaspe. If it is hacked, the entire cluster, workloads, and third party components are compromised. 

Yet, *etcd* does not provide any encryption capabilities. Instead, the data field of each Kubernetes API object (e.g. Secrets and ConfigMap), composed or not of sensitive data, will be encoded in base64 to protect the data integrity during client-server exchanges.  

#### Architecture Overview
The below diagram illustrates the Creation opertion workflow of a Kubernetes Secret object: 

!!! info inline end  
    For this diagram, the data field flows through a series of component, usually TLS encupsulated. However, the origin and destination are considered unsafe due to the lack of data encryption.
 
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant User or App
participant etcd
participant API Server
autonumber
  User or App->>API Server: create Secret mysecret
  Note right of User or App: base64 encoded data field
  API Server->>etcd: store Secret
```

#### Operation Overview
Let's consider an application in needs of credentials to connect to an endpoint.  

```bash title="Encoding the values in base64 (Linux/Unix)."
echo 'admin' | base64
echo 'p@ssw0rd$' | base64
```

!!! warning inline end  
    While convenient from a GitOps perspective, the YAML manifest is optional as secrets can be create using the ```kubectl create secret``` command.  
    However, the manifest is **unsafe**; the data field values can be decoded on any system giving back the original values.

``` title="Inserting the values within a Secret manifest: mysecret.yml"
--8<-- "files/mysecret.yml"
```

```bash title="Creating a Secret based on a YAML manifest." 
kubectl apply -f mysecret.yml
```

## Iterative Design

### Case Study 

### Securing Kubernetes Secrets 
Let's zoom in on the mindmap focusing on Kubernetes CRUD operations to define the potential attack surface and build an iterative mitigation path.

#### etcd

##### Overview

By design, etcd provides a TLS for transport and authentication but no [encryption capabilities](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/security/#does-etcd-encrypt-data-stored-on-disk-drives). The project's mitigations offered are:  
 
- Let client applications encrypt and decrypt the data
- Use a feature of underlying storage systems for encrypting stored data like [dm-crypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt)

In other words, these two options refer to:

- from a Kubernetes perspective, clients are the CLI toolings via the API server;
    - tools like ```kubectl``` or others would have encryption capabilities to secure the data field.  
      However, within the context of Kubernetes and its workload, it would require both the API server and the applications to somehow know that the data field is encrypted and how to decrypt for CRUD operations.   
    - the Kubernetes API server has an encryption at rest configuration API object  ```EncryptionConfiguration``` to configure [encryption providers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/). This approach streamlines the process as every CRUD operations depends on the API server which will handle the encryption/decryption requests.  
- from a deployment perspective, etcd will consume available storage from the master node(s), storage that could be encrypted using different options, one being dm-crypt.  
  
##### Mitigation

While the CLI tooling approach might address the unsecure manifest and ease GitOps practice, it would be a rather significant implementation. Reducing the implementation complexity by using the existing ```EncryptionConfiguration``` would ease the consumption of secrets but leave the Ops with an unsecure manifest. 

While using the ```EncryptionConfiguration``` protects the data field for Secrets and ConfigMap, it does not encrypt all the other API object definition like Pods, Services, StatefulSet, ...

While encrypting the data at the disk/file system level will protect any CRUD operations on the etcd content being written on disk, it will not protect against unauthorized etcd client access.

***Therefore, both options are required to reduce the blast radius.***  

!!! success
    Encrypt all master node(s) disk or/and any storage endpoint used by etcd.  
    Leverage the Kubernetes ```EncryptionConfiguration``` to handle data field encryption operation via the API server and a defined provider (See [API](#API) for more details).

!!! bug 
    A request for enhancement to the Kubernetes project might be required to provide encryption for every API object definition.

#### Manifest

##### Overview

One would consider to simply use the ```kubectl``` command to create the secret and it would be fine if the workstation is hardened to avoid memory and console footprints. This would reduce the autonomy and velocity of an agile development leveraging a container platform as it will require a manual request to the credential owner to inject the secret with the platform before any deployment activities.   

Another would consider that applications have to rely on a Key Management Service (KMS) to retrieve their secrets instead of using the unsecure etcd. This approach removes the security burden of managing secrets within Kubernetes. While from application/workload perspective it might be feasible, Kubernetes core components might not be able to for resilience reasons. If a core component, network or storage related, would not be able to access the KMS to retrieve. Here are some examples:

- network components like CoreDNS, NGINX, ...
- storage components like Ceph, Ondat, ... 
- persistent volume being encrypted at rest and storing their encryption key as secrets
- cert-manager storing the private certificate
- Service Accounts 

Here is two example of secrets created by a freshly deployed Kubernetes clusters from different vendors:

Considering the GitOps practice, revisioning a Kubernetes Secret manifest would be similar as providing the sensitive data to the entire organization, and even more in case of breach.
