## a hybrid cloud story

This demo is leveraging the [skupper example hello world](https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper-example-hello-world) demo to showcase the journey from a development enviroment to a hybrid-cloud deployment. During the walkthrough, the following concepts will be explored:

- how to build a secure container image? or how to include security at the early stage for a frictionless production-grade deployment
- how to deploy applications in a PaaS or even CaaS approach? or how to release in full "gated" autonomy
- how to support split front-end/back-end architecture? or how to leverage the cloud to deploy applications within data sovereignty environment
